# Course Information

## Staff

**Lecturer**: Sam Chinnery (chinnery)

**TAs**: Tim Magoun (magoun), Savannah Inglin (singlin), Reed Foster (reedf)

## Overview

This course is designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of practical
electrical engineering (EE) in a relaxed, project-oriented environment. There
are no prerequisites for this class; the only requirements are creativity and an
interest in EE. Due to the limited availability of lab resources, **enrollment
in this course is restricted to first-year students**. 

## Prerequisites

None

## Lectures

Lectures will be held on **Monday and Wednesday, from 2:30 to 4:00pm in 4-231**.
**Attendance at all lectures is mandatory**. 

## Labs

All lab work should be completed in the 6.117 lab space (**38-601**). There are
three lab sections:
- Section 1: **Monday/Wednesday, 4:00 – 7:00pm**
- Section 2: **Tuesday/Thursday, 1:00 – 4:00pm**
- Section 3: **Tuesday/Thursday, 4:00 – 7:00pm**

Students will be assigned to their choice of section if possible.

## Grading

This course is offered for 6 units of credit. Grades will be assigned on a
**P/D/F** scale. All students who complete the lab assignments in good faith and
attend all lectures should expect to pass.

# Course Material

## Objectives

The 2018 Undergraduate Perceptions Survey revealed a significant difference in
the perception of EE at MIT between people internal to and external to the
department. This course is intended to mitigate that difference by providing
opportunities for students to engage with EE in a project-oriented environment
and establishing a community of like-minded individuals interested in EE as a
major or for personal projects. This course provides a comprehensive overview to
practical EE through **lectures, labs and a design project**.

The lectures will introduce students to **basic circuit techniques**, including
Kirchoff’s laws (KVL and KCL), intuitive analysis and simulation. The lab
assignments are designed to familiarize students with the use of **EE lab
equipment**, including power supplies, oscilloscopes and function generators.

Following the completion of two lab assignments, students will work on a larger
design project assignment. The design project is designed to expose students to
more **complex systems while maintaining a hands-on approach**. Course staff
will be available throughout the course and will provide guidance to students
during the labs and project.

## Lectures

A tentative schedule of lectures is as follows:
- Lecture 1: **Introduction and basic circuit theory** *Wednesday, January 15*

  *Friday, January 31*
    - Learn more about EE
    - Talk to upperclassmen in Course 6-1 and 6-2
    - Food will be served

## Labs

Students will complete two introductory lab assignments prior to the design
project. Each lab will include instructions on how to conduct the lab as well as
a short handout. The lab assignments are designed to be **completed during one
3-hour lab session**.

**Lab 1** familiarizes students with basic EE lab equipment and standard lab
procedures. Exercises will include measurements with digital multimeters (DMMs)
and oscilloscopes, basic function generator operation, and construction of a
simple oscillator using the LM555 timer.

**Lab 2** will cover intermediate circuit techniques presented in Lecture 2.
Exercises will introduce active components, including common-emitter BJT
amplifiers and simple op-amp circuits (inverting amplifiers, non-inverting
amplifiers and second-order filters). Students will construct a discrete Class
AB audio amplifier using a push-pull BJT output stage.

## Design Project

The design project will be distributed following the completion of Lab 1 and 2.
The design project is intended to allow students to engineer a **complex,
mixed-signal system**. The design project will incorporate principles from
Lecture 1 – 3 and is intended to be easily understandable. After completing the
design project, students will have designed and assembled a self-contained audio
amplifier with remote lock/unlock capabilities. The digital lock can be
repurposed to control a variety of devices.

The design project will be completed in **three lab sessions**. During the first
session, students will complete the digital lock/unlock circuit. The digital
lock will be implemented using a shift register and a digital comparator, which
will activate when a specific 4-bit password is presented at the input. During
the second session, students will complete the audio amplifier. The audio
amplifier is implemented as a 1-watt Class AB amplifier driven by a Class A
preamplifier. During the third session, students will complete the
remote-control circuitry and finish any remaining components from previous
sessions. Remote functionality will be implemented with a 38 kHz
amplitude-modulated (AM) infrared receiver/transmitter system.

## Timeline
A tentative schedule of all lectures, labs and assignments is as follows:

Following the completion of the course, an EE opportunities and experiences
panel will be held as an opportunity for first-year students to deepen their
knowledge of Course 6-1 and EE-related opportunities and careers. Food will be
provided. The panel will be held on **Friday, January 31, from 1 – 3pm in
4-231**.
